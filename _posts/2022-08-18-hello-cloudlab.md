CloudLab is a “virtual lab” for experiments on networking, cloud computing, and distributed systems. It allows experimenters to set up real (not simulated!) end hosts and links at one or more CloudLab host sites located around the United States. Experimenters can then log in to the hosts asociated with their experiment and install software, run applications to generate traffic, and take network measurements.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use CloudLab to run experiments in computer networks or cloud computing. It should take you about 60-90 minutes of active time to work through this tutorial.

> **Note**
> This process has a “human in the loop” approval stage - students will need to wait for an instructor or research advisor to approve their request to join their project. They should be prepared to start the tutorial, wait for this approval, and then continue.
